1. processing plugins may be slow, so it should be moved to a separate thread
	1.1. while doing so we should show some kind of loading indicator
	1.2. maybe we should come up with some more efficient algorithms for each plugin?

2. should only active plugins be loaded? maybe IsActive property of a plugin should be checked each time it's run since plugin state may change based on what user 
   changed in settings
	2.1. plugin loading/initialization will probably be remade when we'll start developing user settings functionality
	2.2. I don't like how Colorizer picks colors - sometimes colors for each project are almost undistinguishable. change algorithm that generates random numbers?
	2.3. think about hierarchical coloring strategy - projects should be easily distinguished from test suites and test suites from steps, FLAT strategy gives the same color
		 for each item in project
	2.4. when testsuite is chosen before it's project is chosen, then it gets some random color, which is not being overridden when project is chosen. we should change that.
		 the same applies to step -> testsuite relation and step -> project relation. maybe showing some default color for unbound items would do the trick?

3. let's think about using PostSharp - there are some places it could be applied, but is it worth extending the compilation time?
